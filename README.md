*Automated leaf segmentation applied to a leaf fragment from the Denver Basin, Colorado.  DMNH EPI_63864*

apply_models.ipynb is a Google Colab file containing a template for applying the segmentation model and the leaf area reconstruction method to images of fossil leaves.  Segmentation can be run online either over CPU or using a Colab GPU.  A test image (*Petrea rotunda* UCMP 947) is provided in this repository, but new images can be uploaded to Colab, or the file can be downloaded and run locally with local images.

The trained model is stored on google drive because filesize is too large to upload to github. Model can be accessed at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xg2csnX-3LhNyY_GDg9n2L8CiMlThD-z
