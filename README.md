Reconstruct Fossil Leaf Area with Secondary Vein Density

Butrim, Matthew J.; Koger, Benjamin; Robertson, Samuel S.; Currano, Ellen D. 

apply_models.ipynb is a Google Colab file containing a template for applying the segmentation model and the leaf area reconstruction method to images of fossil leaves.  A test image is provided in this repository, but new images can be uploaded to Colab, or the file can be downloaded and run locally with local images.

Functions are stored in functions.py

Trained model is stored on google drive as filesize is too large to upload to github. Model can be accessed at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xg2csnX-3LhNyY_GDg9n2L8CiMlThD-z/view?usp=drive_link
