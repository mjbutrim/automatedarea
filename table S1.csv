"Table S1: Leaf area reconstruction data.  File Name refers to the image file name and corresponds with image file names used in Butrim and Royer (2020).  Conversion is the pixel to cm conversion factor for the image.  PreArea is the area in cm^2 reported in Butrim and Royer (2020).  FragArea is the area measured directly from the alphashape hull.  Median_area is the area calculated from secondary vein density using Eq 1.  log_area, log_frag, and median_stat are PreArea, FragArea, and MedianArea log10-transformed.  error is the absolute difference between the median_stat and log_area.  Median is median secondary vein density.  n is number of successful rectangles.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
